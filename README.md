Hello, this is the source code repository for [Ride with Bikes], by
[mike castleman].

The site as currently conceived is a bunch of files with no logic on
the server; everything is done on the client with Javascript.

There are some unit tests (with [QUnit]) in the `test` subdirectory.

See the COPYING file for details on the various works incorporated
into this site.

If you're still reading this and have any questions, get in touch.
